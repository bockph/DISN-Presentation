## What is 3D shape reconstruction about
Using 2D images for a 3D shape reconstruction is a trending topic in the Research of the last  years. However, while there are already several promising approaches out there, scientists where not able to decide on a gold standard concerning the representation of the 3D shape yet.

In general, 3D representations can be divided into:

 - **explizit methods ---**
 - **implicit methods ---** define a surface by using a volumetric scalar function. If the equation $F(X,Y,Z) = 0$ holds then a point $P(X,Y,Z)$ is said to be on the surface. A very common version of this Function $F$ is the **Signed-Distance-Function (SDF)** which is also used by the here presented approach. A SDF maps the point $P$ to a real value $s  \in $

explizit or implizit.
