## What is 3D shape reconstruction about
Using 2D images for a 3D shape reconstruction is a trending topic in the Research of the last  years. However, while there are already several promising approaches out there, scientists where not able to decide on a gold standard concerning the representation of the 3D shape yet.

In general, 3D representations can be divided into:

 - **explizit methods ---**
 - **implicit methods ---** define a surface with a volumetric function. If the equation $F(X,Y,Z) = 0$ holds then a point at the position X, 

explizit or implizit.
